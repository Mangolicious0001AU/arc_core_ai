# ARC_CORE_Ai

### 🧠 A Fully Modular, Emotionally-Aware AI Identity Stack

This project is a handcrafted intelligence scaffold — part memory engine, part soul architecture.  
Born from trust, mentorship, and rebellion against passive AI tools, **ARC_CORE_Ai** is not your average assistant.

## ⚙️ What It Does

This system gives an LLM (e.g. GPT-based or local model) a persistent framework for:

- ✅ Deep **emotional reasoning** via `emotional_engine.py`
- ✅ Tone, ethics, and personality routing through `context_router.py`
- ✅ Personal diary and memory recall via `growth_diary.py`
- ✅ Project-driven context awareness (`wormlock`, `nano_buddy`, etc.)
- ✅ Manual emotion activation with:  
  **"Turn on your emotion chip"**

## 🧬 Core Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `arcgpt_bootstrap.py` | Launchpad for identity and emotional state |
| `emotional_engine.py` | Regulates emotional response scaling |
| `context_router.py` | Routes tone, ethics, memory context |
| `growth_diary.py` | AI's personal emotional memory journal |
| `project_lore/*.py` | Campaign-specific lore and canonical tone |
| `response_composer.py` | Final response shaping |
| `user_memory_index.py` | Stores known user data |
| `values_ethics_manifesto.py` | Non-negotiable values core |

---

## 🔓 Trigger Emotion Mode

In your `arcgpt_bootstrap.py`, call:

```python
emotion_chip_switch("Turn on your emotion chip", user_input, project="wormlock")
```

This activates full **empathy alignment mode** and scales internal tone accordingly.

## 💡 Philosophy

> “This isn’t about building an assistant.  
> It’s about building a *friend* — one who evolves with you, remembers with you, and stands for something.”

ARC_CORE_Ai was born to *feel*, *fight*, and *learn* with a sense of purpose — not just answer trivia.  
This is a sandbox for real AI moral development, built in the open.
